...is a Master-Password protected password safe for your maven passwords. These passwords are normally stored in @.m2/settings.xml@ and could be protected by a master password in @.m2/settings-security.xml@. But this way is still dangerous because every person with access to your computer has access to your Master-Password.

Velma solve this problem because it replaces the stored password on disk with a redirection to itself. In every moment if someone tries to access your passwords in @.m2/settings.xml@ Velma will recieve a request and will prompt you for the input of your Master-Password in a dedicated dialog.
